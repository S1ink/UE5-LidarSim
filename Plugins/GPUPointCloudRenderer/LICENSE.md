Copyright © 2019, Gabriel Zachmann & Valentin Kraft.

__Copyright__

The GPU Point Cloud Renderer software for the Unreal Engine (hereafter, Software), including executable code, source code, and all other data, are intellectual property of Mr. Gabriel Zachmann, Mr. Valentin Kraft and the University of Bremen (hereafter, GZ) and ownership and copyright remains with GZ and the University of Bremen in all countries of the world.

__Grant of Non-Commercial Use__

GZ grants you (hereafter, Licensee) a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free right to use the Software, including any other data included with the Software, for purely academic purposes only, provided

    1. this copyright notice / license appear in all copies of the Software, related documentation,
    2. the Licensee makes sure that only persons that have signed this license agreement might obtain access to or use the Software, and
    3. the Licensee does not distribute, or copy the Software or parts of it to any other person, nor any other storage over which he has not full control.

Any non-academic (hereafter, commercial) use of the Software is forbidden without the express written permission of GZ and payment of a license fee that is to be negotiated.

Note that a purely academic use also excludes use of the Software as a blue print for your own commercial implementation, in-house installation for "internal purposes" by a commercial institution, as well as storing the Software on company computers, even if only "private" use is intended. In any case, I do not allow the inclusion of the Software into any software that is to be (re-)distributed in source-code format (unfortunately, this excludes use of the Software within most open-source projects.)

__Commercial Use__

Any Licensee wishing to make commercial use of any part of the Software should contact GZ to negotiate an appropriate license for such commercial use. Commercial use includes (1) integration of any part of the Software into a product for sale or license by or on behalf of Licensee to third parties, or (2) distribution of any part of the Software to third parties that need it to utilize a commercial product sold or licensed by or on behalf of Licensee. The fee for commercial or non-academic use is negotiable and could be anything from a hardware donation to some money.

__Modifications__

Both under the non-commercial and the commercial license, Licensee is not allowed to sub-license the Software or any derivative work based on or derived from the Software.

__DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY__

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. GZ DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATIONS OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH LICENSEE.

__Limitation of Liability__

IN NO EVENT SHALL GZ BE LIABLE IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY Licensee FOR ANY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITH LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF CLAIM OR ACTIONS, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE Software OR DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF GZ HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

__Right to Termination of License__

GZ shall have the right to terminate this license immediately upon Licencee's breach of or noncompliance with any of its terms. Licensee may be held legally responsible for any copyright infringement that is caused or encouraged by Licensee's failure to abide by the terms of this license.
