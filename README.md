# UE5-LidarSim

## Installation
⚠️ **Important** ⚠️

The third party dependencies were too large to store directly within the repo, so they have been zipped and attached under the [releases tab](https://github.com/S1ink/UE5-LidarSim/releases/tag/thirdparty-binaries)! Follow the provided instructions for proper installation. Other than this the project should be usable out of the box - although a manual rebuild may be required when switching engine versions.
